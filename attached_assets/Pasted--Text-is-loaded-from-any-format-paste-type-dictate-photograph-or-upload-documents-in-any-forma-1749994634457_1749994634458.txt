Language barriers are more than just misunderstandings. They are measurable business risks.
Safety risks
Misunderstanding safety instructions leads to workplace injuries, fines and reputational damage. The Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority points to this as a significant risk factor.

Reduced productivity
Errors in task execution, equipment damage and prolonged onboarding of new employees directly impact operational efficiency.

High costs
Sending hundreds of workers to general language courses is expensive, time-consuming and ineffective for learning specialized work vocabulary 'here and now'.

Lost sales
In customer service, inability to understand customer needs leads to lost sales and negative reviews.

How Elvarika works: Your personal linguistic processor
1. Upload any content
Simply provide the system with a text document, photo of instructions or even a voice message.

2. Elvarika generates audio lesson
Our unique pedagogical engine automatically identifies key terminology, creates 'Anchor Context' from your document for standardized knowledge, translates and produces high-quality audio.

3. Team learns effectively
Employees listen to ready playlists, while the built-in spaced repetition algorithm (SRS) ensures long-term retention.

Not just a 'text-to-speech', but a powerful learning tool
'Anchor Context'
For each term, the system uses sentences from your original document. This guarantees that the entire team understands critical information uniformly and unambiguously.

Intelligent repetition (SRS)
The system automatically creates new sentences for repetition, weaving in words that the learner begins to forget. This is a scientifically proven method for maximum learning efficiency.

'Screen-free' learning
Passive audio format allows integrating learning into work processes or daily tasks without time loss. Perfect for busy adults.

HR analytics
The admin panel provides managers with data on team learning progress. Evaluate investment effectiveness and monitor knowledge acquisition.

Built for industries where every word matters
Logistics and warehouses
Manufacturing and construction
HoReCa and services
Agriculture
Logistics and warehouses
Rapid acquisition of terminology: 'forklift', 'cargo labeling', 'safety procedures'. Increase safety and work efficiency in the warehouse.
